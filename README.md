## Notes

This site was created in a weekend, so the codebase is not the cleanest. I did my best to clean it for publishing, but it could be better.

Because the site was created in November 2013, when Express 3.x was the latest, the routes and module patterns aren't yet compatible with Express 4.x. This could be easily remedied in an afternoon.
